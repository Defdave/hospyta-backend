# Summary about myself
- I'm a self taught software dev. I have been seeking for an intern or junior role where I can learn from inspiring devs, and gain actual work experience and i just started learning nodejs/nestjs cause of this intern i have experience with nodejs/expressjs so this task might not have be well done, unconventional as it may seem, can I get such an opportunity? I promise you would smile back at this decision because I'm a hard worker and I learn really fast.
